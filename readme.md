This is a test to run a android (and possibly ios in the future) + rust app.

To get started, make sure these environment variables exist:
- `ANDROID_HOME`, referring to the `Android/Sdk` folder. Potential locations are:
  - `C:/Users/%USER%/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk`
  - `/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk`
- `NDK_HOME`, referring to the Android `ndk-bundle` folder. Potential locations are:
  - `%ANDROID_HOME%/ndk_bundle`
  - `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk_bundle`

Then run your platform's `setup_ndk` command
